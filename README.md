# GeocodeFlask
A web app that utilizing flask. This app receive location that passed in HTTP requests to get the coordinate data. Then calculate the distance between Moscow Ring Road  and specified location

**How to Run**
1. This app is using yandex api, first go to app.py and see KEY_API variable
You can change it by your own

2. To use it open Command Prompt and direct to the flaskapp folder

**Test Case**

In this project there are two seperate function that are separated from main program, it is measureDistance.py and getCoordinate.py

1. getCoordinate.py
This program is generate coordinate, in latitude and longitude of the specified location. 
The function _getCoordinate()_ is receive xml file to return the coordinate. 
This program is handled by some of unit test in test_getCoordinate.py.

There are three testing, 
- input is int or float type
- input is a boolean type
- input is a filename but not .xml type

to check the unit test you can run it by type this on command prompt
python -m unittest test_getCoordinate.py

You will see something like this on the shell

2. measureDistance.py
This program is calculate a distance between Moscow Ring Road and specific location 
The function _measureDistance()_ is receive latitude and longitude value, which is generated by getCoordinate.py. 
This program is handled by some of unit test in test_measureDistance.py.

There are 4 testing, 
- If input is Moscow Ring Road latitude and longitude, it should return 0
- input is int or float type, that have complex number
- input is a boolean type
- input is a string type

to check the unit test you can run it by type this on command prompt
python -m unittest test_measureDistance.py

You will see something like this on the shell

**XML File**
XML file will always updated, when the user is input a new location. The file is stored in ./flaskapp named data.xml
